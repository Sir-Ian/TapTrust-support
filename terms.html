  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
  <p>By downloading or using TapTrust, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

  <h2>2. Purpose</h2>
  <p>TapTrust provides age verification tools using Apple Wallet mobile IDs and physical ID barcode scanning. TapTrust does not guarantee legal compliance in all jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to ensure the app is used in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

  <h2>3. No Data Storage</h2>
  <p>TapTrust does not collect or store personal data from IDs. Operators using the app may manually record verification outcomes, but no personal data is saved by TapTrust itself.</p>

  <h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>TapTrust is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We are not responsible for misuse of the app, failure to verify IDs, or compliance failures by third-party businesses.</p>

  <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, TapTrust and its developers are not liable for damages resulting from the use of the app.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of TapTrust after updates constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, email us at <a href="mailto:help@taptrust.app">help@taptrust.app</a>.</p>
